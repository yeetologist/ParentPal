To revolutionize child nutrition and combat global malnutrition issues, our project employs machine learning. Recognizing the lack of tools for mothers, "ParentPal" emerges as a mobile application guided by three key research questions. Firstly, it trains machine learning models to assess a child's nutrition based on diet and measurements. Secondly, it utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze growth patterns and identify potential issues. Lastly, it harnesses nutritional data and preferences to generate personalized diet recommendations


"ParentPal" empowers parents by allowing them to input dietary and growth data, providing real-time assessments.. With the potential to transform how we approach child nutrition, "ParentPal" is a technological solution addressing the critical need for accessible tools and guidance for mothers worldwide.
